        		Science and Computer Science
National Chemistry Olympiad: I took the Local Chemistry Olympiad exam and earned a high enough score to advance to the National level among the top 1000 students in the country.

Michigan State University (Summer 2015 – 7 weeks): Last summer, I worked in Dr. Friesen’s Plant Biology Lab where I researched the potential benefits of mixed nodules in Medicago plants that are inoculated with a fixing and a non-fixing variety of the same strain of rhizobia. My research culminated with a 20-page research paper.

Cornell University (Summer 2014 – 7.5 weeks): I took two college classes - Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures and Introduction to Cognitive Science. In the first, I built my own data structure that incorporated the functionality of many different existing data structures, modeled real world problems and simulated an entire civilization that is rapidly expanding. For the other course I explored how humans think by analyzing how our brain works, how our brain represents ideas, and the impact of language on our minds.

JETS (9-12, JV Captain): To deepen my understanding of engineering, I earned a spot on the highly competitive JETS team. I was one of 3 freshman invited to participate in the Computer Science and Math sections. Sophomore year, I competed on the Sectional team, helping my team earn 3rd place. This year I placed first in the Regional Competition in Chemistry and 4th in Chemistry at State helping the team place 1st for the first time ever.

Leadership
Investment Club (9-10 Treasurer, 11-12 President): As president, I form sector groups, which analyze different types of stocks (i.e. technology, consumer economics, international). Each sector group recommends 3 stocks for the club to invest in. As a club, we vote on which stocks we’d like to invest in and how many shares of each stock we’d like to buy. I collect the money, and the waivers, and secure the stocks. Throughout the year, we meet every three weeks to monitor the progress of our investments, listen to guest speakers, participate in a mock stock exchange game, and learn about investing strategies. At the end of the school year, I sell all the stocks and distribute the profit to the members based on their investment percentage. 

Micro-Finance Club (9-12 President): As a freshman, I became hooked on the Micro-Finance club. I love reading business plans of entrepreneurs from third world nations and granting loans with the funds we raised in our fundraisers. Each year I help organize our club’s biggest fundraiser (an annual Ping-Pong tournament) which has raised over $1500 from sponsors, players participation fees, concessions sales, and T-shirt sales. These funds support entrepreneurs like Mostafa who doubled his “dry cleaning” business in Mozambique by buying a second used washing machine.

Peer Leadership (10-12 Leader): I guide 12 freshmen through their first year of high school. I conduct six classes a year, guiding my freshmen through role-playing, interactive games, and group discussions to empower them to navigate high school. 


Breaking Down the Walls (9-12): I participated in a rigorous application and interview process to join this select anti bullying group.  We write scripts that are either turned into plays or movies that tell stories from teenage perspectives, based on personal experiences. The plays are performed live at high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools. The films are featured at school assemblies and on our school’s website and posted on YouTube. One of the movies I acted in can be seen at: http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v =Xat573x_cbs&feature=youtube.


Just For Fun - Acting 
Forensics (10-12): After several intense rounds of tryouts, I made our nationally ranked team. My events are SOS (Special Occasions Speech), DDA (Dramatic Duet Acting), HDA (Humorous Duet Acting), and INFO (Informative Speaking). Each Saturday, I compete against over 100 students usually placing in the top 6. As a sophomore, I competed on our team’s PIR (Performance in the Round) winning 5th place in the Illinois State competition. Additionally, this year, my partner and I placed 4th at the District competition in Debate.

Drama Club (9-10 member, 11-12 Advisory Board Member): Every month, I run Drama Club meetings by discussing upcoming plays and opportunities to get involved. Additionally, I plan field trips for the club to go to professional plays in downtown Chicago. I design posters for our productions and hang them up around the school.

Fall Play (10): I was one of ten kids selected to star in the play “Inherit the Wind.” My role was Radio Man. I loved the challenge of balancing my course work, club commitments, and play commitments. At the end of 8 weeks of practice, we performed three shows for the community.

Freshman Play (9, Actor/script writer): One of 12 students selected for the play “Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind.” After practicing the art of improvisation for 8 weeks and writing skits based on our personal lives, we put on three performances. Each performance consisted of sixty original one-minute plays.  Learning to think on my feet before a live audience was both terrifying and exhilarating.

Community Service
Peer Jury (8-12, Juror): Four years ago, I joined Peer Jury, a program that provides kids under 18 who have brushes with the law an opportunity to learn from their mistakes and keep their record clean.  As a Peer Juror, I listen to the arresting police officers, the offenders, and the offenders’ parents and determine the consequences. My job is to help the teenagers learn from their mistakes and improve their lives. The minimum sentence is ten hours of community service to help them build a connection to their community. Additionally, I have an array of additional programs I can assign as well. For example, an offender who has anger issues will be required to attend M.A.S.K. (Managing Anger Skills) classes. As one of the more experienced Jurors, I also interview prospective Jurors and mentor new Jurors.

Hinsdale Hospital Junior Board (8-10): Our goal is to raise money for the hospital. Each year we put on an ice cream social in our community. Two years ago was the 60th year of the ice cream social. The money we raise helps fund new projects at the hospital such as a new patient wing and a new cancer center. Additionally, we participate in activities to make the patients’ hospital stays more enjoyable, such as making and delivering blankets to chemotherapy patients.
 
Community Service in Ecuador (Summer 2013 – 4 weeks): Diving into a western Amazon community for four weeks was a once in a lifetime experience.  While contributing to building a community center and a school, I led my group. Throwing my heart, soul, and muscles into these community service projects allowed me to help a community much different than my own (as well as learn a little construction). After a full day hiking to reach the remote village, it was clear that the Amazon people I met were apprehensive as I was one of the first white people they had ever seen.  They soon realized we were there to help them as we carried logs over a mile through a forest to the village where the community center was needed. Using shovels, I mixed bags of cement to layer in-between cinder blocks for the foundation and walls. When the buildings were finally complete, the villagers celebrated with a feast.
