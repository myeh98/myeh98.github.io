# You have money, now what? (How you see money changes from person to person)

What do you want money for? Do you want it to 
- Have financial security?
- Pay for a relative's medical bills?
- Provide a better life for your children?
- Take a significant other out to nice restaurant without worrying about the price?
- Donate?

I know there is a lot of anti-money sentiment at this school, but the fact of the matter is that money is just a tool to achieve your goals. It is a constraint in an optimization problem and that's it.

Don't just tell other people how to allocate their money because they might have different values than you. You might want to grow your money but someone else might have fear surrounding it. Don't assume they are coming from the same place as you - different upbringings, different values, etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmAwa1nnB6w. 

# Personal Finance 101

Day today finances: monitor your budgeting for 2 months, then see if you can decrease anything. There is no point in trying to set a budget without knowing a realistic benchmark. You cannot improve anything if you don't have metrics on what you are trying to improve.

1. Set up your budget
2. Buy insurance (if necessary)
3. Pay off all bad debt (defintion varies, my defintion any debt greater than >5%: credit cards, loans, etc. )
4. Start an emergency fund - cover 3+ months of your budget
5. Start investing

## Everyone starts off if a different boat. There is no you OUGHT to be here by now, there is only where you are and what you should do to improve your financial situation according to YOUR goals

If you are a low-income student with a lot of debt, you probably aren't looking at what the difference between a Roth and traditional 401(k). That's totally fine! Don't freak out! (Also if this is you, keep an eye out for Biden's student relief package that hopefully will come but don't rely on it).

If you are an heir to a family fortune, you also probably don't care about this or already know it. But hey the information is here for everyone!

# Behavioral Personal Finance 102

Just like with any tough habit, like exercising or eating healthy, it might be incredibly hard to just jump in and start saving the max amount you ought to be saving.

Instead of just giving up, start small and build habits.

In terms of paying off debt, some people find it easiest to pay off the smallest debt first (not the one with the highest interest rate even though this is the most "logical" one to start with). Start small, build the habit of paying off debt, and keep going. This is called the Waterfall method if you are looking for more resources.

You know yourself best, can you start with the largest, highest interest debt or should you start small and work from there. Do whatever is best for you.

# Ask for a singing bonus

You would be surprised how many companies will give you singing bonuses if you just ask. It also saves you A LOT of money. This is because you get your signing bonus when you start to work. You likely will work half the year (july to december or less) and so your income for the year will be taxed at a lower rate.

# Shut up and Save

The overwhelming amount of Americans below the age of 40, don't save (yes there are a lot of reasons why a lot of these Americans don't save, but even for those that can, they don't). They have no self control and don't save. If you put $6k a year in a Roth IRA you would be a millionaire by the time you retire. As a Princeton student, there is a giant chance you will be able to save at least $6k every year. 

There is absolutely 0 point talking about investing, retirement, or anything of this nature if you don't shut up and save.

# Insurance
If you don't have dependents, do not pay for life insurance. No one is relying on your income don't waste your money. If you do have dependents, aim for 10x your income at least. 

Health insurance, you are young and healthy, Medicare is a tax on you to pay for the old/sick. Do the cheapest option. BUT get the option such that if you were in a serious emergence (get hit by a car that shatters all your bones and you have cancer), they will pay for everything. This should all be covered under the cheapest option just be sure to cover your worst case.

# Why open an IRA or 401(k)?

These are essentially just tax shelters. You want to avoid tax as much as possible (pay what is legally required of you).

# How to open an IRA or 401(k)

Your options are really 1) Charles Schwab, 2) Fidelity, or 3) Vanguard.
Feel free to look up other options and do your own research. If you come across a website that doesn't list these 3 in the top 5, leave that website immediately.
For full diclosure I use Fidelity but it really makes 0 difference between these 3.

# Which is better 401(k) or IRA?

Yes.

In all seriousness, a 401(k) is likely better because your employer will match some of your contributions. If you max at your 401(k) it will likely be around 3%, but imagine being able to buy all the stocks at 3% lower price than everyone else. That would be amazing!

# If you aren't earning much income but CAN afford to save, do a Roth-401(k) or Roth IRA

Your income will never be this low again in your life. Pay the tax you owe right now at this low rate and never pay tax on the money again. For those that are confused, this is essentially just a tax-advantaged account.


# Okay tell me where I should put my money!

Eh, you're young. Roughly:

80% Total Stock Market Index Funds

10% US REIT (Real Estate)

5% US Bonds / T-bills

5% Cash (what happens if the stock market crashes by 30% again, BUY BUY BUY RIGHT NOW)

## You said "Index Funds", should I buy ETFs or Mutual Funds?

Personally, I prefer mutual funds. Some economists are worried that there's an ETF bubble (Shoutout to Prof Bogan). 

I am less worried about a bubble but essentially an ETF is supposed to mimic a mutual fund exactly. The slight advantage of an ETF is you get immediate liquidiy - if you wake up at 11am EST and you go OH NO TECH STOCKS ARE GOING TO PLUMMET RIGHT NOW, you can sell your position immediately with an ETF. You have to wait for end of business hours for a mutual fund. The slight disadvantage is with an ETF that you don't actually own an underlying asset. A stock means you own a piece of a company so if Macy's goes bankrupt and liquidates, you as a stock holder are entitled to some of that value. If Macy's liquidates and you hold a Macy's ETF, you don't own anything tough luck. Personally, I feel more comfortable with owning a piece of a "real" asset knowing that I am not smart enough to predict the suddent plunge in the stock market intra-day to make a meaningful difference.

(Stock market crashes are almost always occur across multiple days. The coronavirus crash dropped 30% over like 2 weeks, not 1 day. There are stock market shock short-circuits that prevent the entire stock market from dropping more than 5%? 8%? in a day). 

# Final Rant Against Robinhood

Let's pretend you are a genius and you can beat the market and get 10% returns every year by day trading while also working a job. Your job pays you $100k. Your effective tax rate is about 32%. Your post-tax gains from your returns is now 6.8%. Instead of 1) hoping you're a genius and can beat the wall street professionals in your spare time and 2) even then do WORSE than the average market returns. Just put your money in a general fund and forget about it.

It also gamifies people's savings which I think is evil. If you have no self control and an ego like myself, it is good to create friction between yourself and your investment account so you don't treat your savings like a game. It is an investment, it's not supposed to be fun. 

# A Personal Rant
Please please please just save. You are getting the best education in the world, make good financial decisions. Also having money doesn't make you a bad person.

To end my personal note, this is just general advice, you know your money situation + your values better than anyone else on the planet.
